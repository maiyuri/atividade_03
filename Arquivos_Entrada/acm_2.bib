abstract = {Currently Big Data is the biggest buzzword, and definitely, we believe that Big Data is changing the world. Some researchers say Big Data will be even bigger buzzword than the Internet. With fast-growing computing resources, information and knowledge a new digital globe has emerged. Information is being created and stored at a fast rate and is being accessed by a vast range of applications through scientific computing, commercial workloads, and social media. In 2018, over 28 billion devices globally, are connected to the internet. In 2020, more than 50 billion smart appliances will be connected worldwide and internet traffic flow will be 92 times greater than it was in 2005. The usage of such a massive number of connected devices not only increase the data volume but also the velocity of data addition with speed of light on fiber optic and various wireless networks. This fast generation of enormous data creates numerous threats and challenges. There exist various approaches that are addressing issues and challenges of Big Data with the theory of Vs such as 3 V's, 5 V's, 7 V's etc. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate the status of the current Big Data domain. Further, a comprehensive overview of Big Data, its characteristics, opportunities, issues, and challenges have been explored and described with the help of 51 V's. The outcome of this research will help in understanding the Big Data in a systematic way.},

abstract = {It is still challenging in telecommunication (telco) industry to accurately locate mobile devices (MDs) at city-scale using the measurement report (MR) data, which measure parameters of radio signal strengths when MDs connect with base stations (BSs) in telco networks for making/receiving calls or mobile broadband (MBB) services. In this paper, we find that the widely-used location based services (LBSs) have accumulated lots of over-the-top (OTT) global positioning system (GPS) data in telco networks, which can be automatically used as training labels for learning accurate MR-based positioning systems. Benefiting from these telco big data, we deploy a context-aware coarse-to-fine regression (CCR) model in Spark/Hadoop-based telco big data platform for city-scale localization of MDs with two novel contributions. First, we design map-matching and interpolation algorithms to encode contextual information of road networks. Second, we build a two-layer regression model to capture coarse-to-fine contextual features in a short time window for improved localization performance. In our experiments, we collect 108 GPS-associated MR records in the centroid of Shanghai city with 12 x 11 square kilometers for 30 days, and measure four important properties of real-world MR data related to localization errors: stability, sensitivity, uncertainty and missing values. The proposed CCR works well under different properties of MR data and achieves a mean error of 110m and a median error of $80m$, outperforming the state-of-art range-based and fingerprinting localization methods.},

However, the emerging trend of public misinformation due to the chunk of information available on the internet affects public opinion formation (POF) about universities. Therefore, narrowing down on the fallouts in POF can provide evidence for managerial and policy interventions. This paper explores five-layer POF and its application with big data in university public opinion monitoring and processing. It reveals that big data technology can be actively employed to safeguard the image of university public opinion formation, but this can be inhibited by the lack of commitment to integrating multiple stakeholders on a common platform, privacy, and security concerns. The paper recommends collaboration between universities and the government to increase momentum on big data with requisite actions for mutual benefits.},

abstract = {In many health care domains, big data has arrived. How to manage and use big data better has become the focus of all walks of life. Many data sources provide the repeated fault data—the repeated fault data forming the delay of processing time and storage capacity. Big data includes properties like volume, velocity, variety, variability, value, complexity, and performance put forward more challenges. Most healthcare domains face the problem of testing for structured and unstructured data validation in big data. It provides low-quality data and delays in response. In testing process is delay and not provide the correct response. In Proposed, pre-testing and post-testing are used for big data testing. In pre-testing, classify fault data from different data sources. After Classification to group big data using SVM algorithms such as Text, Image, Audio, and Video file. In post-testing, to implement the pre-processing, remove the zero file size, unrelated file extension, and de-duplication after pre-processing to implement the Map-reduce algorithm to find out the big data efficiently. This process reduces the pre-processing time, reduces the server energy, and increases the processing time. To remove the fault data before pre-processing means to increase the processing time and data storage.},

However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions.

abstract = {Big Data is becoming a substantial part of the decision-making processes in both industry and academia, especially in areas where Big Data may have a profound impact on businesses and society. However, as more data is being processed, data quality is becoming a genuine issue that negatively affects credibility of the systems we build because of the lack of visibility and transparency of the underlying data. Therefore, Big Data quality measurement is becoming increasingly necessary in assessing whether data can serve its purpose in a particular context (such as Big Data analytics, for example). This research addresses Big Data quality measurement modelling and automation by proposing a novel quality measurement framework for Big Data (MEGA) that objectively assesses the underlying quality characteristics of Big Data (also known as the V's of Big Data) at each step of the Big Data Pipelines. Five of the Big Data V's (Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity and Validity) are currently automated by the MEGA framework. In this paper, a new theoretically valid quality measurement model is proposed for an essential quality characteristic of Big Data, called Validity. The proposed measurement information model for Validity of Big Data is a hierarchy of 4 derived measures / indicators and 5 based measures. Validity measurement is illustrated on a running example.},

In particular, we present our solutions to the ``last mile'' issues in providing a rich developer ecosystem. This includes easy ingress from and egress to online systems, and managing workflows as production processes. A key characteristic of our solution is that these distributed system concerns are completely abstracted away from researchers. For example, deploying data back into the online system is simply a 1-line Pig command that a data scientist can add to the end of their script. We also present case studies on how this ecosystem is used to solve problems ranging from recommendations to news feed updates to email digesting to descriptive analytical dashboards for our members.},

abstract = {Solving the missing-value (MV) problem with small estimation errors in big data environments is a notoriously resource-demanding task. As datasets and their user community continuously grow, the problem can only be exacerbated. Assume that it is possible to have a single machine (`Godzilla'), which can store the massive dataset and support an ever-growing community submitting MV imputation requests. Is it possible to replace Godzilla by employing a large number of cohort machines so that imputations can be performed much faster, engaging cohorts in parallel, each of which accesses much smaller partitions of the original dataset? If so, it would be preferable for obvious performance reasons to access only a subset of all cohorts per imputation. In this case, can we decide swiftly which is the desired subset of cohorts to engage per imputation? But efficiency and scalability is just one key concern! Is it possible to do the above while ensuring comparable or even better than Godzilla's imputation estimation errors? In this paper we derive answers to these fundamentals questions and develop principled methods and a framework which offer large performance speed-ups and better, or comparable, errors to that of Godzilla, independently of which missing-value imputation algorithm is used. Our contributions involve Pythia, a framework and algorithms for providing the answers to the above questions and for engaging the appropriate subset of cohorts per MV imputation request. Pythia functionality rests on two pillars: (i) dataset (partition) signatures, one per cohort, and (ii) similarity notions and algorithms, which can identify the appropriate subset of cohorts to engage. Comprehensive experimentation with real and synthetic datasets showcase our efficiency, scalability, and accuracy claims.},

As we might expect, then, the Requirements Engineering would play a similar role in the context of Big Data applications. However, practicing Requirements Engineering is a challenging and complex task. It involves (i) stakeholders with diverse backgrounds and levels of knowledge, (ii) different application domains, (iii) it is expensive and error-prone, (iii) it is important to be aligned with business goals, to name a few. Because it involves such complex activities, a lot has to be understood in order to properly address Requirements Engineering. Especially, when the technology domain (e.g., Big Data) is not yet well explored. In this context, this paper describes a research plan on Requirements Engineering involving the development of Big Data applications. The high-level goal is to investigate: (i) On the technical front, the Requirements Engineering activities with respect to the analysis and specification of Big Data requirements and, (ii) on the management side, the relationship between RE and Business Goals in the development of Big Data Software applications.},

abstract = {High-quality power data is the basis for reliable operation of power systems, efficient data processing, and effective mining of the potential value of power data. How to use big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies to evaluate the quality of power data is a hot research topic in the field of electric power. At present, most of the power data quality evaluation methods are simple and lack the research of general data quality evaluation model. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data quality evaluation model based on a multi-head attention mechanism. The model measures multiple indicators such as completeness, accuracy, smoothness, and correlation. The corresponding methods are used to quantify these indicators to form a data quality evaluation index system oriented to multi-dimensional indicators; then, an application feedback mechanism based on a multi-head attention network is used to correct the calculation weights and score outputs, so as to achieve the evaluation of power data quality. Finally, the validation analysis is carried out based on the electricity data of a region in China. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the quality of electric power data.},

abstract = {Proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology has expedited the realization of Smart City. To enable necessary functions, sensors distributed across the city generate a huge volume of stream data that are crucial for controlling Smart City devices. However, due to conditions such as wears and tears, battery drain, or malicious attacks, not all data are reliable even when they are accurately measured. These data could lead to invalid and devastating consequences (e.g., failed utility or transportation services). The assessment of data reliability is necessary and challenging especially for Smart City, as it has to keep up with velocity of big data stream to provide up-to-date results. Most research on data reliability has focused on data fusion and anomaly detection that lack a quantified measure of how much the data over a period of time are adequately reliable for decision-makings. This paper alleviates these issues and presents an online approach to assessing Big stream data reliability in a timely manner. By employing a well-studied evidence-based theory, our approach provides a computational framework that assesses data reliability in terms of belief likelihoods. The framework is lightweight and easy to scale, deeming fit for streaming data. We evaluate the approach using a real application of light sensing data of 1,323,298 instances. The preliminary results are consistent with logical rationales, confirming validity of the approach.},

In this context, personal data receive particular attention, witch its laws and guidelines that ensure better and legal use of data. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - in the European Union - and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD) - in Brazil - lead to anonymisation (and its processes and techniques) as a way to reach secure use of personal data. However, expectations placed on this tool must be reconsidered according to risks and limits of its use, mainly when this technique is applied to Big Data. We discussed whether anonymisation used in conjunction with good data governance practices could provide greater protection for privacy. We conclude that good governance practices can strengthen privacy in anonymous data belonging to a Big Data, and we present a suggestive governance framework aimed at privacy.},

The approach is demonstrated in a use case together with a set of experiments that demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach for the scalable execution of Big Data workflows.

Enterprise Architecture (EA) can be used as an instrument to integrate big data (BD) in the existing business processes and ICT-landscape. In this policy paper, we explore the role of EA in the adoption of BD. For this, we adopted a qualitative case study approach and investigated a large administrative organization that was in the process of adopting BD. We found in our case study that the first attempts were focused on integrating big data in the current landscape, but this encountered too many challenges that halt progress. To overcome the challenges, a separate BD department and accompanying infrastructure was created. The strategy was first to reap the benefits of BD and to understand what should be done, and thereafter integrating the working systems in the existing landscape. The findings suggest that current infrastructures might not be suitable for integrating BD and substantial changes are needed first. In the case the role of BD needed to be first clarified before EA could play a role in adopting BD. EA should deal with the uncertainties and complexities by ensuring a configurable landscape, by providing an incremental approach for adapting the infrastructure step-by-step, before the benefits of big data can be gained. Developing an incremental migration plan was found to be a key aspect for the adoption of BD.},

abstract = {The growth of spatial big data has been explosive thanks to cost-effective and ubiquitous positioning technologies, and the generation of data from multiple sources in multi-forms. Such emerging spatial data has high potential to create new insights and values for our life through spatial analytics. However, spatial data analytics faces two major challenges. First, spatial data is both data-and compute-intensive due to the massive amounts of data and the multi-dimensional nature, which requires high performance spatial computing infrastructure and methods. Second, spatial big data sources are often isolated, for example, OpenStreetMap, census data and Twitter tweets are independent data sources. This leads to incompleteness of information and sometimes limited data accuracy, thus limited values from the data. Integrating spatial big data analytics by consolidating multiple data sources provides significant potential for data quality improvement in terms of completeness and accuracy, and much increased values derived from the data. In this paper, we present our vision of a high performance integrated spatial big data analytics framework. We provide a scalable spatial query based data integration engine with MapReduce, and demonstrate integrated spatial data analytics through a few use cases in our preliminary work. We then present our future plan on integrated spatial big data analytics for improving public health research and applications.},

abstract = {The analytics platform at Twitter has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years in terms of size, complexity, number of users, and variety of use cases. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of our infrastructure and the development of capabilities for data mining on "big data". One important lesson is that successful big data mining in practice is about much more than what most academics would consider data mining: life "in the trenches" is occupied by much preparatory work that precedes the application of data mining algorithms and followed by substantial effort to turn preliminary models into robust solutions. In this context, we discuss two topics: First, schemas play an important role in helping data scientists understand petabyte-scale data stores, but they're insufficient to provide an overall "big picture" of the data available to generate insights. Second, we observe that a major challenge in building data analytics platforms stems from the heterogeneity of the various components that must be integrated together into production workflows---we refer to this as "plumbing". This paper has two goals: For practitioners, we hope to share our experiences to flatten bumps in the road for those who come after us. For academic researchers, we hope to provide a broader context for data mining in production environments, pointing out opportunities for future work.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the booming of big data analytical applications (BDAAs). This trend provides unrivaled opportunities to reveal the latent patterns and correlations embedded in the data, and thus productive decisions may be made. This was previously a grand challenge due to the notoriously high dimensionality and scale of big data, whereas the quality of service offered by providers is the first priority. As BDAAs are routinely deployed on Clouds with great complexities and uncertainties, it is a critical task to manage the service level agreements (SLAs) so that a high quality of service can then be guaranteed. This study performs a systematic literature review of the state of the art of SLA-specific management for Cloud-hosted BDAAs. The review surveys the challenges and contemporary approaches along this direction centering on SLA. A research taxonomy is proposed to formulate the results of the systematic literature review. A new conceptual SLA model is defined and a multi-dimensional categorization scheme is proposed on its basis to apply the SLA metrics for an in-depth understanding of managing SLAs and the motivation of trends for future research.},

The conventional approaches for health data management have achieved limited success as they are incapable of handling the huge amount of complex data with high volume, high velocity, and high variety. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the existing challenges, techniques, and future directions for computational health informatics in the big data age, with a structured analysis of the historical and state-of-the-art methods. We have summarized the challenges into four Vs (i.e., volume, velocity, variety, and veracity) and proposed a systematic data-processing pipeline for generic big data in health informatics, covering data capturing, storing, sharing, analyzing, searching, and decision support. Specifically, numerous techniques and algorithms in machine learning are categorized and compared. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss the essential prospects lying ahead for computational health informatics in this big data age.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Internet technology has promoted the process of economic globalization, and the application of big data technology has injected new vitality into the innovation of foreign exchange management models. Businesses such as foreign exchange deposits and loans and foreign currency exchange have encountered new development opportunities. Under the effect of big data technology, it can quickly process massive amounts of information, respond to various exchange rate changes, and achieve the improvement of foreign exchange business management. Especially under the circumstances of the current RMB marketization, exchange rate reform and the diversification of the international situation, the difficulty of foreign exchange management is gradually increasing. How to better improve the efficiency of foreign exchange management has become a problem that must be solved at present. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the foreign exchange management model based on the background of big data, build a big data computing mechanism, give full play to its advantages in foreign exchange management, and promote the improvement of foreign exchange management.},

abstract = {The problem of privacy-preserving data mining has been studied extensively in recent years because of its importance as a key enabler in the sharing of massive data sets. Most of the work in privacy has focussed on issues involving the quality of privacy preservation and utility, though there has been little focus on the issue of scalability in privacy preservation. The reason for this is that anonymization has generally been seen as a batch and one-time process in the context of data sharing. However, in recent years, the sizes of data sets have grown tremendously to a point where the effective application of the current algorithms is becoming increasingly difficult. Furthermore, the transient nature of recent data sets has resulted in an increased need for the repeated application of such methods on the newer data sets which have been collected. Repeated application demands even greater computational efficiency in order to be practical. For example, an algorithm with quadratic complexity is unlikely to be implementable in reasonable time over terabyte scale data sets. A bigger issue is that larger data sets are likely to be addressed by distributed frameworks such as MapReduce. In such frameworks, one has to address the additional issue of minimizing data transfer across different nodes, which is the bottleneck. In this paper, we discuss the first approach towards privacy-preserving data mining of very massive data sets using MapReduce. We study two most widely-used privacy models k-anonymity and l-diversity for anonymization, and present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.},

Processing big data became essential for enterprises to garner general intelligence and avoid biased conclusions. Due to these features, big data processing is considered to be a challenging task. Big data Processing should rely on a robust network. Cloud computing offers a suitable environment for these processes. However, it is more challenging when we move big data to the cloud, as managing the cloud resources is the main issue. Software Defined Network (SDN) has a potential solution to this issue. In this paper, first, we survey the present state of the art of SDN, cloud computing, and Big data Stream processing (BDSP). Then, we discuss SDN in the context of Big Data Stream Processing in Cloud environment. Finally, critical issues and research opportunity are discussed.},

These characteristics are integrated into a conceptual model of the system and data model for citizen science applications. Furthermore, the paper describes a way to measure data quality using the data quality characteristics. The models and measuring methods are theoretical and can be adapted into case specific designs.},

abstract = {Geospatial Big Data analytics are changing the way that businesses operate in many industries. Although a good number of research works have reported in the literature on geospatial data analytics and real-time data processing of large spatial data streams, only a few have addressed the full geospatial big data analytics project lifecycle and geospatial data science project lifecycle. Big data analysis differs from traditional data analysis primarily due to the volume, velocity and variety characteristics of the data being processed. One of a motivation of introducing new framework is to address these big data analysis challenges. Geospatial data science projects differ from most traditional data analysis projects because they could be complex and in need of advanced technologies in comparison to the traditional data analysis projects. For this reason, it is essential to have a process to govern the project and ensure that the project participants are competent enough to carry on the process. To this end, this paper presents, new geospatial big data mining and machine learning framework for geospatial data acquisition, data fusion, data storing, managing, processing, analysing, visualising and modelling and evaluation. Having a good process for data analysis and clear guidelines for comprehensive analysis is always a plus point for any data science project. It also helps to predict required time and resources early in the process to get a clear idea of the business problem to be solved.},

In addition, there is no difference between the data escrow transaction mode and the aggregate transaction mode, and the rights of the data supply parties cannot be guaranteed. And it also discusses how to promote the construction and improvement of China's big data trading market more systematically, normally and institutionally.
